# Election Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this project is to assist Seth, who works for the Colorado Elections Commission, and his manager Tom to 
analyze and confirm the results of the election. To accomplish this goal Tom and Seth produced the data for every vote
in the election. This data came in the format of a csv (comma separated values) file.
